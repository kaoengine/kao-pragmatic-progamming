The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.
## Team trust
## Take Responsibility
Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don’t blame all the problems
on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may
play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn’t come through for you, then you should have had a
contingency plan. If your mass storage melts—taking all of your source code with it—and you
don’t have a backup, it’s your fault. Telling your boss “the cat ate my source code’’ just won’t cut it.
