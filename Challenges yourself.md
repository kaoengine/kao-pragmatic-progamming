How do you react when someone—such as a bank teller, an auto mechanic, or a clerk—
comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a
result?
When you find yourself saying, “I don’t know,” be sure to follow it up with “—but I’ll find out.”
It’s a great way to admit what you don’t know, but then take responsibility like a pro.
