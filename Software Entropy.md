Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of “disorder” in a system.

When disorder increases in software, we call it “software rot.” Some
folks might call it by the more optimistic term, “technical debt,” with the implied notion that they’ll
pay it back someday. They probably won’t.

Whatever the name, though, both debt and rot can spread uncontrollably.
