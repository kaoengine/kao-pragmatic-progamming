### Early adopter/fast adapter
You have an instinct for technologies and techniques, and you love trying things out. When
given something new, you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your
knowledge. Your confidence is born of experience.
### Inquisitive
You tend to ask questions. That’s neat—how did you do that? Did you have problems with
that library? What’s this quantum computing I’ve heard about? How are symbolic links
implemented? You are a pack rat for little facts, each of which may affect some decision
years from now.
### Critical thinker
You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts. When colleagues say “because
that’s the way it’s done,” or a vendor promises the solution to all your problems, you smell a
challenge.
### Realistic
You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face. This realism gives you
a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things will take. Deeply understanding
that a process should be difficult or will take a while to complete gives you the stamina to
keep at it.
### Jack of all trades
You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies and environments, and you
work to keep abreast of new developments. Although your current job may require you to be
a specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges.
